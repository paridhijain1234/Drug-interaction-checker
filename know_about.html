                            When a medication works right, it boosts your health or helps you feel better. But a drug
                            can bring on problems if it doesn't mix well with something else you put into your body,
                            like another medication, a certain food, or alcohol.

                            When that happens, it's called a drug interaction. It could make your medication stop
                            working, become less effective, or too strong. It could also trigger side effects.

                            The more you learn about drug interactions, the better you'll be able to avoid them. Here's
                            what you need to know.

                            The main types are:

                            Drug-drug interaction. This is when a medication reacts with one or more other drugs. For
                            example, taking a cough medicine (antitussive) and a drug to help you sleep (sedative) could
                            cause the two medications to affect each other.

                            Drug-food/drink interaction. This is when something you eat or drink affects a drug. For
                            instance, it can be dangerous to drink alcohol while you're on certain medications. Some
                            vitamins and dietary supplements interact with medicines, too.

                            Drug-condition interaction. This is when you have a health problem that makes it risky for
                            you to take certain meds. For example, if you have a condition like high blood pressure,
                            taking a decongestant for a cold could drive up your blood pressure even more.

                            There are many types of drugs you shouldn't take together, but in general, don't take
                            combinations like these:

                            Two or more drugs that share an active ingredient. You could have side effects or an
                            overdose. Active ingredients are the chemicals in medications that treat your condition or
                            symptoms. Always check for them on the drug label.

                            Blood-thinning drugs with NSAIDs. Your odds for a dangerous bleed could go up. NSAIDs
                            (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. If
                            you're on a blood thinner, ask your doctor to suggest a different type of over-the-counter
                            pain medication and dose that's safer for you.

                            Pills with antihistamines. Taking these together can cause you to react more slowly, which
                            would make it dangerous for you to drive or work with heavy machines.

                            Some other drug-drug combinations that can be dangerous are:

                            An NSAID pain reliever with a blood pressure drug
                            A thyroid drug called levothyroxine with an acid-blocking proton pump inhibitor drug called
                            omeprazole
                            An SSRI antidepressant with another medicine that affects serotonin (such as
                            dextromethorphan, linezolid, tramadol, and trazodone)
                            A cholesterol-lowering statin with antifungal and fibrate meds that are commonly called
                            "azole" drugs (Their technical names are "imidazole and triazole derivatives." They lower
                            blood fats called triglycerides.)
                            The antibiotic clarithromycin with a type of blood pressure drug called a calcium channel
                            blocker

                            Certain foods and drinks don't mix well with some medications. A few of these are:

                            Alcohol. Booze can bring on dangerous side effects with many medications, including some
                            drugs for:

                            Allergies
                            Cold and flu
                            High cholesterol
                            High blood pressure
                            Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
                            Depression
                            Diabetes
                            Infections
                            Pain
                            Poor sleep
                            Before you start a new medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it could interact with
                            alcohol. Check the drug label for alcohol warnings, too.

                            Grapefruit or grapefruit juice. Too much of either can affect some drugs like:

                            Statins
                            Antihistamines
                            Blood pressure drugs
                            Anxiety meds
                            Transplant anti-rejection drugs
                            Grapefruit juice doesn't mix badly with every type of drug in these classes of medications.
                            Check your drug's label or information pamphlet for any warnings about it. Also, ask your
                            doctor or pharmacist if it's safe to have grapefruit or its juice in any amount with your
                            specific drug. If they tell you to stop eating or drinking it, ask if any other fruits or
                            juices might have similar effects on your medicine.

                            Foods with vitamin K, like leafy greens. These can interact with the blood thinner warfarin.
                            You don't have to stop eating them, but it's important to be consistent and not overdo it.
                            Ask your doctor how much food with vitamin K you can have, then eat the same amount around
                            the same times each week.

                            High-potassium foods and drinks, like bananas, salt substitutes, and orange juice. These can
                            affect blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors. Your doctor will track your potassium
                            levels, and they may tell you to cut back on foods with it.

                            St. John's wort. This herbal dietary supplement can affect many medications for heart
                            disease, HIV, depression, and other conditions. It can also affect birth control pills and
                            the cancer drugs irinotecan and imatinib.

                            Always get your doctor's or pharmacist's OK before you try a new supplement. It's also
                            possible for a medication you take to interact with a health condition you have. Some common
                            drug-condition interactions happen between:

                            Antacids and kidney disease
                            Antihistamines and certain breathing problems, glaucoma, and enlarged prostate
                            Asthma rescue inhalers and conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid
                            disease, and diabetes
                            Decongestants and conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, and
                            diabetes

                            The symptoms of a drug interaction can vary a lot, depending on the drugs you’re taking and
                            how they’re interacting. Sometimes you might not even know right away that an interaction is
                            happening.

                            If you do notice an interaction, it will usually feel like one of these is happening:

                            You are having more side effects from a drug
                            Your drug doesn’t seem to be working as well as it was before
                            In general, call your doctor if you're having side effects that worry you or if your
                            medicine doesn't seem to be working, especially after you’ve recently started or changed
                            doses of a drug.

                            There are several ways that drugs can interact with one another. Here are some examples of
                            the most common ways.

                            When two drugs can cause the same side effect and are used at the same time, they might
                            cause more of that side effect. For example, if two drugs can each make you sleepy, taking
                            them together can make you more or dangerously sleepy.

                            When the unwanted effects of one drug are the opposite of the desired effects of another
                            drug, you might end up with less of the desired effects. For example, taking one medication
                            that raises blood pressure as an unwanted effect may decrease the benefits of taking another
                            medication to lower your blood pressure.

                            Most drugs that you swallow enter your blood through your intestines. Sometimes a drug or
                            supplement can block or trap another drug in the intestine before it can be absorbed. For
                            example, supplements like calcium and iron can prevent absorption of thyroid meds.

                            Your body has enzymes, such as the cytochrome p450 (CYP) and others, that process many types
                            of medications. This is called metabolism. It also has a way to get rid of drugs, usually
                            though your urine. Other drugs may speed up, slow down, or even completely block these
                            functions. When this happens, the amount of drug in your body may increase (similar to
                            taking too much) or decrease (similar to taking too little). Either way, this could cause
                            serious problems.

                            Work closely with your doctor. Make sure they know all the medicines, vitamins, and
                            supplements you're taking. That's extra important if you have more than one doctor who
                            prescribes medicines for you. You could show them a list of the meds you're taking, or bring
                            the medication packages to your appointment.

                            Before you take a new drug, ask your doctor or pharmacist questions like:

                            Can I take this with my other meds?
                            Should I avoid certain foods, drinks, or other products?
                            Could this medication interact with any health conditions I have?
                            Pharmacists are experts on medicine safety, and they can work with your doctors to help you
                            avoid drug interactions. For example, if you have two doctors and they separately prescribe
                            drugs that interact, your pharmacist can warn them -- and you -- before you have a problem.

                            Read labels carefully. Over-the-counter drug labels include information about possible drug
                            interactions and the medication's active ingredients. Prescription medications usually come
                            with a sheet that explains what the drug is and how to take it safely.

                            But most drug labels and patient handouts don't list every possible drug interaction. Talk
                            to your pharmacist to get the full picture. They can also answer any questions about medical
                            terms or jargon on the drug packages.
